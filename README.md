# TweetE
Tools for scraping of twitter data, conversion, text analysis and graph construction. This software consists of several easy-to-use Python modules for several aspects of natural language processing with Twitter

### twitter_analysis

### pyTweet
This module enables data scientists to build large datasets for graph analytics. It can be very difficult to obtain data sets for big data analysis, along with developing architecture for processing and storage. With pyTweet, a user can easily select a sampling method and have the collection run unsupervised. Profile and timeline metadata are saved in JSON file format. Modules add-ons can process the JSON files into a PostgreSQL database with a graph-like schema. See the README.pdf and README.md within pyTweet fro getting started.
