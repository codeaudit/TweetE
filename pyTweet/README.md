About
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This module enables data scientists to build large datasets for graph 
analytics. It can be very difficult to obtain data sets for big data analysis, 
along with developing architecture for processing and storage. With pyTweet, a 
user can easily select a sampling method and have the collection run 
unsupervised. Profile and timeline metadata are saved in JSON file format. 
Modules add-ons can process the JSON files into a PostgreSQL database with a 
graph-like schema.
